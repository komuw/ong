Taken mainly from the talk; `How I Write HTTP Web Services after Eight Years`[1][2] by Mat Ryer.    


You really should not be using this code/library. The Go `net/http` package is more than enough.    
If you need some extra bits, may I suggest the awesome [github.com/gorilla](https://github.com/gorilla) web toolkit.    



This library is made just for me, it might be unsafe & it does not generally accept code contributions.
